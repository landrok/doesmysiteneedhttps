Some notes people from the Internet are telling me about this page :

- we don't speak about DANE / TLSA
  - yes we could (at the CAA / PKI question?)
  - or we couldn't : nobody check those records anyway :/

- shall we recommend CloudFlare, although it's a centralized web service, making the web a more dangerous place (centralisation is bad) ?
  - yes, we could remove this
  - maybe not, many people are using it to secure their website, ... it still enhance the safety of the web ?
  - also, using the HTTPS provided by cloudflare doesn't remove your responsability to use https on your final webserver if you want to encrypt the stream between you and cloudflare.
    (although cloudflare allows you to put invalid cert on your webserver, we don't need that hack anymore, right?)
  

- it's promoting Caddy Web server a tad too much, isn't it?
  - yes, but this page have been invented by caddy webserver developer ;)
